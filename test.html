    <!--pound p7 works better than defined a p2 a la h1, h2, etc., even though p2 by itself and use below works. Not sure which is better practice.-->
    <!--note: never start id or class Selectors with numbers-->
    <!--can do .important to apply to all element types-->

    <p>This is a preliminary, hopefully HTML5 compatible, test webpage, a proving ground for updates to the CNSO website. </p>
    <p>    Okay,    apparently the title "tag" of an html document is not displayed.</p>
    <p> Apparently, you can store the css attributes for a...particular html file? in a separate, "nearby" .css file.</p>
  <iframe class="youtube-player" type="text/html" width="640" height="385" src = "http://www.youtube.com/embed/oHg5SJYRHA0" frameborder="0"> 
  </iframe> 

    <p>The above was using the youtube-recommended iframe object. Below is the HTML5 native video object...which apparently requires an actual video file as opposed to a link.</p>
  <!-- ><video width="320" height="240" controls="controls" src="http://www.youtube.com/v/oHg5SJYRHA0">
    Your browser does not support the video tag.
  </video>  -->

  <p id=p7> A p7 element instance without p6 or even p1 usage!</p>
